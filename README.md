# BP-Project
A comprehensive C++ library for matrix and vector operations with automatic HTML report generation. Designed as a final project for the Fundamentals of Computer Science and Programming course at the University of Guilan (Iran).

✨ Features
Complete Matrix Operations:
Addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication
Matrix multiplication with dimension validation
Transpose operation
Recursive determinant calculation (up to 4×4)
Matrix inverse using adjugate method
Complete Vector Operations:
Addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication
Dot product (inner product)
Cross product (3D vectors only)
Magnitude calculation and normalization
Professional HTML Reporting:
Beautiful responsive design with RTL support for Persian content
Semantic HTML5 tags (<header>, <section>, <footer>)
Clear visual distinction between inputs (blue) and outputs (green)
Dimension labels for all matrices and vectors
Mathematical notation for operations (×, ·, ⁻¹, ᵀ)
Detailed error messages with Persian localization
Robust Error Handling:
Dimension mismatch in addition/subtraction
Invalid dimensions for multiplication
Non-square matrices for determinant/inverse
Singular matrices (determinant ≈ 0)
Invalid vector dimensions for cross product
🚀 Quick Start
Prerequisites
